Problem Statement: Personalized Greeting Application

Create a Tkinter GUI application that allows users to input their name using an Entry widget. Upon clicking a "Submit" button, display a personalized greeting message below the input area. Additionally, implement a feature that allows users to select their preferred greeting from a list of options (e.g., "Hello," "Hi," "Greetings"). Display the selected greeting along with the user's name when the "Submit" button is clicked.

Requirements:
The GUI should include:

An Entry widget for users to input their name.
A "Submit" button to trigger the greeting display.
A Listbox containing different greeting options (e.g., "Hello," "Hi," "Greetings").
A Label to display the personalized greeting.
When the user clicks the "Submit" button:

Retrieve the entered name from the Entry widget.
Retrieve the selected greeting from the Listbox.
Display a greeting message combining the selected greeting and the user's name.
Ensure that the GUI is user-friendly, and the layout is well-organized.

Implement error handling for cases where the user does not enter a name or does not select a greeting.
